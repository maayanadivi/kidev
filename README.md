# KIDEV 
## A programming learning site for children
## The site was established by Maayan Nadivi & Alice Aidlin

We have built a friendly and interesting website for children, which offers a variety of educational games and learning programming in a colorful and fun way.
The site is in Hebrew and provides free study materials.
In an age where social networks are leading, we know how important technology and programming are in our daily lives.
With our website, we offer young and curious children a new and fascinating learning experience, combining games and interesting activities
We create an equal and accessible opportunity for children to experience programming and develop mental and constructive thinking abilities
We developed an advanced website using advanced tools.
On the client side (Front-End), we used React JS technology with the MUI framework to build the user interface
For state management on the site, we used Redux technology that helps with central state management and data storage.
To manage the software packages, we used the NPM tool - Node Package Manager
In addition, using the GIT tool we managed the process of developing and integrating the code
We chose the Vercel platform, which provides the ability to develop and publish fast and efficient code.
With every tool and technology we used, we made sure to maintain high standards and combine them impressively to create an excellent user experience and smooth operation of our website
